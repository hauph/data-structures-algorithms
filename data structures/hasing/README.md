## Definition:

- A common technique for storing data in such a way that the data can be inserted and retrieved very quickly.
- Uses a data structure called a **hash table**, which provides fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
- Perform poorly for operations that involve searching, such as finding the minimum and maximum values in a data set (For these operations, other data structures such as the binary search tree are more appropriate).
