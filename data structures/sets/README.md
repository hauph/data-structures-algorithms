## Definition:

- A collection of unique elements.
- Elements of a set are called members.
  - Members of a set are unordered.
  - No member can occur in a set more than once. 
  - A set containing no members is called the *empty* set. The *universe* is the set of all possible members.
  - Two sets are considered equal if they contain exactly the same members.
  - A set is considered a subset of another set if all the members of the first set are contained in the second set.
- Can be useful creating a data structure that consists only of unique elements (eg: a list of each unique word in a text).
