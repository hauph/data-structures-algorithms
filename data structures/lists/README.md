## Definition:

- an ordered sequence of data.  
- no predetermined number of data item (elements) that can be stored in a list (though the practical limit will be the amount of memory available to the program using the list).

<u>**Note:**</u> Lists are especially useful if we donâ€™t have to perform searches on the items in the list or put them into some type of sorted order.
